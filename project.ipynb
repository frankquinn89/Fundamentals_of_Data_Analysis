    "# Fisher's Iris data set\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher's Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The dataset consists of measurements from three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each species is represented by 50 samples, making a total of 150 data points. The dataset includes four features (variables) for each sample, which are measurements in centimeters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sepal Length: This is the length of the iris flower's sepal (the outermost petal-like part).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sepal Width: This is the width of the iris flower's sepal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Petal Length: This is the length of the iris flower's petal (the inner, often colorful part).\n",
    "\n",
    "Petal Width: This is the width of the iris flower's petal."
