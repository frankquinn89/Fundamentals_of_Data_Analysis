## What is Fisher's Iris Data Set?

<p>The Iris Fisher dataset is a famous dataset in machine learning and data analysis, containing 150 samples of Iris flowers, with each sample described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is used for various tasks, such as classification and clustering. The flowers in the dataset belong to three different species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica. The dataset was created by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 and has since become a standard dataset used for testing and comparing machine learning algorithms. The dataset is available in CSV format.
