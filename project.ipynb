    "# Fisher's Iris data set\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher's Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The dataset consists of measurements from three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each species is represented by 50 samples, making a total of 150 data points. The dataset includes four features (variables) for each sample, which are measurements in centimeters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sepal Length: This is the length of the iris flower's sepal (the outermost petal-like part).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sepal Width: This is the width of the iris flower's sepal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Petal Length: This is the length of the iris flower's petal (the inner, often colorful part).\n",
    "\n",
    "Petal Width: This is the width of the iris flower's petal."

    "The variables include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. They are all measured in centimeters. The below statistics can be used to explain to data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mean: The mean sepal/petal length can be calculated to provide the average length of the sepals/petals in the dataset. It gives a sense of the central tendency of this variable.\n",
    "* Median: The median sepal/petal length is the middle value when the data is sorted, which provides insight into the data's central position and helps detect outliers.\n",
    "* Standard Deviation: The standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of sepal/petal lengths, indicating how much individual data points deviate from the mean.\n",
    "* Minimum and Maximum: Providing the minimum and maximum values helps identify the range of sepal/petal lengths in the dataset.\n",
    "* Percentiles (e.g., 25th and 75th Percentiles): These can help describe the spread and distribution of sepalpetal lengths."
